<a href="http://www.rebsig.com/capybara/">This is a website about capybaras.</a><br>
There's very little semantic information like footer or alt tags. Just lots of divs and paragraphs.
At the very least, I'm pretty confused as to how such a simple website is 1476 lines of code long. Probably because it appears to have been made using Microsoft Word 14.<br>
Using an empty paragraph tag with a NBSP in it doesn't seem like best practice for adding whitespace.<br>
Apparently the hr tag makes a horizontal rule, but is now used semantically rather than presentationally.
